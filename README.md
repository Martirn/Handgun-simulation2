Problem statement
The objective is to determine the safety of using a Ruger Blackhawk handgun for shooting at different angles.
Overall objective
To evaluate the potential risk of injury to the shooter when using a Ruger Blackhawk handgun at various shooting angles. That is from -π to π.
To determine whether shooting at 90 degrees will cause injury.

      Introduction 
The Ruger Single-Six is a single fire arm produced by Sturm, Ruger & Co. The Single-Six was first released in June 1953.
The Single-Six is currently produced as the New Model Single-Six. The term "New Model" simply means that this model includes Ruger's transfer bar mechanism for increased safety, allowing one to carry the revolver safely with all six chambers loaded. Prior to 1973, the Single-Six was produced without the transfer bar mechanism, making it less safe to carry with all six chambers loaded, and with the hammer resting on a loaded chamber. The transfer bar safety allows the revolver to fire only when the trigger has been pulled. Ruger provides the transfer bar safety upgrade free of charge for owners of any old model Single-Six, though this may come with a significant trigger-feel penalty.

Purpose of the handgun
Hunting: Some models of the Ruger Blackhawk, especially those chambered for larger calibers like .44 Magnum or .45 Colt, are suitable for hunting small to medium-sized game. It offers the power and accuracy needed for hunting applications.
Recreation: Many gun owners appreciate the Ruger Blackhawk as a recreational firearm, whether for plinking or historical reenactments. Its classic design and single-action operation can provide an enjoyable shooting experience.
Home Defense: While it may not be the first choice for home defense, some individuals opt to use the Ruger Blackhawk for this purpose due to its reliability and stopping power, especially in larger calibers.
Cowboy Action Shooting: The Ruger Blackhawk is a popular choice in cowboy action shooting sports, where competitors use firearms reminiscent of the Old West. Its single-action operation and classic appearance make it ideal for this purpose.
Assumptions
Initial velocity (v0) of the bullet = 356m/s
Angle of firing (θ) = -π to π
Gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s²
Mass of the bullet =
Parameters:

Time of flight (T): T = (2 * v0 * sin(θ)) / g
Maximum height (H): H = (v0^2 * sin^2(θ)) / (2 * g)
Range (R): R = (v0^2 * sin(2θ)) / g
